# 🚀 The DRock Visual Workspace (Project: Happy Birthday LED Protocol)

## 🎂 What is this?
This is not just a React App. This is a highly sophisticated, cloud-native, AWS-powered digital playground designed specifically for DRock's Birthday.
It serves as a "visual workspace" to experiment with UI, interactivity, and design, but mostly, it serves as a digital monument to how cool my big sister is.

## 🌍 The Two Worlds (Multi-Tenancy)
This app features advanced User Detection Logic (aka "checking the URL," aka basic subdomains).

### 1. The Public Face 🏢
URL: https://rocksystems.cloud
Experience: Standard view. Nice, clean, professional.

### 2. The DRock VIP Lounge 👑
URL: https://d.rocksystems.cloud
Experience: The intended experience.
Logic: The app detects the subdomain and unlocks a custom workspace environment with specific defaults tailored just for her.
